# JavaCheckers
Checkers as implemented in java 

If you look at the source code you may note that
even 
if 
you 
break 
the 
lines,
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph

 Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed 

You may force a line break with two spaces  
or with a `\`\
at the end of the line
